# Refactoring from Prisma to Drizzle ORM

## Overview

This document outlines the process and rationale for refactoring our B2B social networking platform from Prisma ORM to Drizzle ORM.

## Rationale

The decision to migrate from Prisma to Drizzle was based on several factors:

1. **Performance**: Drizzle offers better performance with a smaller footprint and more efficient query execution.
2. **Type Safety**: Drizzle provides strong TypeScript integration with a focus on type safety.
3. **SQL Control**: Drizzle gives developers more direct control over SQL queries, allowing for more optimized database operations.
4. **Reduced Overhead**: Drizzle has a smaller runtime footprint compared to Prisma.
5. **Simplified Schema Management**: Drizzle's schema definition is more straightforward and closer to SQL.

## Migration Process

The migration from Prisma to Drizzle involved the following steps:

1. **Schema Translation**: Converting the schema to Drizzle schema format.
2. **Database Client Setup**: Setting up the Drizzle client and connection pool.
3. **API Refactoring**: Updating all API routes to use Drizzle.
4. **Authentication Updates**: Modifying NextAuth.js configuration to work with Drizzle.
5. **Data Migration**: Creating and executing scripts to migrate existing data.
6. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all database operations to ensure functionality.
7. **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tuning queries and indexes for optimal performance.

## Key Changes

### Schema Definition

The most significant change was in how we define our database schema. We now use a TypeScript-native approach with Drizzle:

**Drizzle Schema Example:**

```typescript
import { pgTable, text, timestamp, boolean, varchar } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';
import { createId } from '@paralleldrive/cuid2';

export const users = pgTable('users', {
  id: text('id').primaryKey().$defaultFn(() => createId()),
  name: text('name'),
  email: varchar('email', { length: 255 }).notNull().unique(),
  emailVerified: timestamp('email_verified'),
  password: text('password'),
  image: text('image'),
  role: text('role').notNull().default('USER'),
  createdAt: timestamp('created_at').notNull().defaultNow(),
  updatedAt: timestamp('updated_at').notNull().defaultNow()
});
